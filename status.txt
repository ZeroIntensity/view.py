200 OK
The request succeeded. The result and meaning of "success" depends on the HTTP method.
201 Created
The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.
202 Accepted
The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.
203 Non-Authoritative Information
This response code means the returned metadata is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource. Except for that specific case, the 200 OK response is preferred to this status.
204 No Content
There is no content to send for this request, but the headers are useful. The user agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.
205 Reset Content
Tells the user agent to reset the document which sent this request.
206 Partial Content
This response code is used in response to a range request when the client has requested a part or parts of a resource.
207 Multi-Status
Conveys information about multiple resources, for situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate.
208 Already Reported
Used inside a <dav:propstat> response element to avoid repeatedly enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection.
226 IM Used
The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.
