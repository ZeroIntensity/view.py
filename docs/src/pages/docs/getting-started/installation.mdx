# Installation

## System Requirements

view.py requires [CPython](https://python.org/downloads/) 3.8 or above.

<Admonition level="question" title="What is CPython?">
    CPython is the reference/official implementation of Python. If you downloaded Python through [python.org](https://python.org) or some sort of system package manager (e.g. `apt`, `pacman`, `brew`), it's probably CPython.
</Admonition>

view.py does **not** officially support PyPy, nor any other implementation of Python. If you're looking for speed, rely on view.py's C extension to do the heavy lifting!

## Installing with Pipx (Recommended)

[pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) can install CLIs into isolated environments. view.py recommends using `pipx` for installation, and then using `view init` to initialize a virtual environment in projects. For example:

<Codeblock fileName="bash">
```bash
$ pipx install view.py
... pipx output
$ view init
```
</Codeblock>

## Installing via Pip

<Codeblock fileName="bash">
```bash
$ pip install view.py
```
</Codeblock>


## Development Version

<Codeblock fileName="bash">
```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py
```
</Codeblock>

## Finalizing

To ensure you've installed view.py correctly, run the `view` command:

<Codeblock fileName="bash">
```bash
$ view
```
</Codeblock>

<Admonition level="danger" title="Linux Problem">
    On Linux, `view` is already a command! Read about it [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/zh/aix/7.2?topic=v-view-command), but in short, it opens `vi` in read only mode. You can either shadow this command with view.py's CLI, or use the `view-admin` command instead, which is an alias. This documentation will assume you use `view` instead of `view-admin`, but note that they do the exact same thing.
</Admonition>

If this doesn't work properly, try executing via Python:

<Codeblock fileName="bash">
```bash
$ python3 -m view
# OR, view-admin, as shown above
$ python3 -m view-admin
```
</Codeblock>
