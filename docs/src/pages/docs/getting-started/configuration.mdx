# Configuration

## Introduction

Before you can make any projects with view.py, you should learn about how it handles configuration. Configuration is handled by the [configzen](https://github.com/bswck/configzen) library under the hood, so most questions about configuration will be answered there.

## The Config File

When creating your app, view will search for one of the following configuration files:

-   `view.toml`
-   `view.json`
-   `view.ini`
-   `view_config.py`

Note that while all of these are different formats, they can all evaluate to the same thing internally. If you have any questions on these semantics, once again see [configzen](https://github.com/bswck/configzen).

## Programatically

Many Python users aren't fond of the configuration file strategy, and that's okay. View supports editing the config at runtime just fine through the `config` property. The `config` property stores a `Config` object, which holds more subcategories.

<Codeblock fileName="app.py">
```py
from view import new_app

app = new_app()
app.config.foo.bar = "..."
```
</Codeblock>

Configurations are loaded at runtime by the `load_config` function. If you would like to use View's configuration file without creating an `App`, you may use it like so:

<Codeblock fileName="app.py">
```py
from view import load_config

config = load_config()
```
</Codeblock>

<Admonition level="note">
    While it's possible to use `load_config` directly, it's not at all recommended. Always prefer `new_app` over trying to manually instantiate the `App` object.
</Admonition>

## Settings

View has several different configuration settings. For documentation purposes, values will be talked about in terms of Python (i.e. `null` values will be regarded as `None`).

At the top level, there's one real setting: `dev`.

`dev` is `True` by default, and is what tells view.py whether you're running in a production server setting or just running on your local machine.

### Environment Variables

If you would like to set a configuration setting via an [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable), you must account for the setting's environment prefix.

All environment prefixes look like `view_<subcategory>_`. For example, the `loader` setting is under the `app` section, so to set `loader` you would use the following command:

<Codeblock fileName="bash">
```bash
$ export view_app_loader=filesystem
```
</Codeblock>

Environment variables can also be set via the `env` config setting, or by adding a `.env` file to the project:

<Codeblock fileName="view.toml">
```toml
[env]
TEST = "hello"
```
</Codeblock>

You can access environment variables via the `view.env` utility:

<Codeblock fileName="app.py">
```py
from view import env

test = env("TEST", tp=int)
# test will be an integer. if environment variable "TEST" does not  exist, an exception is thrown.
# if environment variable "TEST" is not an integer, an exception is thrown.
```
</Codeblock>

## App Settings

**Environment Prefix: `view_app_`**

| Key           | Description                                                                                                                    | Default      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `loader`      | This is the strategy that will be used to load routes. Can be `manual`, `simple`, or `filesystem`.                             | `manual`     |
| `app_path`    | A string defining the location of the app, as well as the variable name. Should be in the format of `file_path:variable_name`. | `app.py:app` |
| `uvloop`      | Whether or not to use `uvloop` as a means of event loop. Can be `decide` or a `bool` value.                                    | `decide`     |
| `loader_path` | When the loader is `simple` or `filesystem`, this is the path that it searches for routes.                                     | `routes/`    |

Example with TOML:

```toml
[app]
loader = "filesystem"
loader_path = "./app"
```

| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |

| `port`       | Integer defining what port to bind the server to.                                                                    | `5000`    |
| `backend`    | ASGI backend to use. Can be `uvicorn`, `daphne`, or `hypercorn`.                                                     | `uvicorn` |
| `extra_args` | Dictionary containing extra parameters for the ASGI backend. This parameter is specific to the backend and not View. | `{}`      |

Example with TOML:

```toml
[server]
host = "localhost"
port = 8080
```

## Log Settings
