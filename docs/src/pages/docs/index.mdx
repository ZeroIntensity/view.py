# Introduction

Welcome to view.py's documentation!

-   [Source](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py)
-   [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/view.py)
-   [Discord](https://discord.gg/tZAfuWAbm2)

Here, you'll learn all about view.py and how to use it.

## Quickstart

<Codeblock fileName="bash">
```
$ pipx run view-py init
# OR
$ python3 -m pip install view.py
$ python3 -m view init
```
</Codeblock>

## Batteries Detachability

So, what does "batteries-detachable" actually mean? It means that we give you everything out of the box, but don't make you use it - instead, we actively support other libraries. **This is what makes view.py unique among other frameworks.**

For example, with our approach to [template engines](/docs/building-projects/templating). We've developed our own flavor of template engine, but include native support for lots of others, including Jinja and Django's internal template engine (which we used some magic to access).

Basically, if you don't want to relearn anything, you don't really have to; you can just keep using what you have been, straight inside of view.py

## This Documentation

Throughout this documentation, it's assumed that you've read the previous pages, like a book. If you're really in a hurry, you can read the "review" section at the bottom of each page.

## Support

You can directly get support from the developers in the [view.py discord server](https://discord.gg/tZAfuWAbm2). Hope to see you there!
