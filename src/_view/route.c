/*
 * view.py internal route implementation
 *
 * This file contains the allocators and deallocator for route structures.
 *
 * Note that technically speaking, there are two types of routes: standard and transport.
 * In the current state, every route is a standard route. However, the unstable and buggy
 * path parameter API uses transport routes to represent path parameters. Read the comment
 * at the top of parts.c for how that works.
 *
 * Standard routes are initialized with route_new(), while transports are
 * initialized with route_transport_new()
 *
 * Essentially, standard route instances hold all proper route fields, except the
 * "routes" and "r" fields. Both of these are NULL in a standard route.
 *
 * In a transport, it's the opposite - everything is NULL except "routes" and "r".
 *
 * Standard routes are responsible for managing the memory of all of their fields.
 * However, the inputs array is not allocated by route_new() - that's done by the loader.
 * The route_free() deallocator expects that the inputs array has been allocated.
 *
 * With that being said, expect everything from typecodes to reference counts to be
 * managed by a route pointer.
